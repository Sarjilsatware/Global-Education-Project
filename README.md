# Global-Education-Project
The Description of this project is to analyze the Global Education System using Power BI to identify key trends, disparities, and insights in education across different countries and regions. This analysis seeks to assist policymakers, educators, and stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to improve educational access and quality worldwide.
## Objectives
1. To collect and clean data related to education indicators such as literacy rate, enrollment
ratio, expenditure on education, teacher-student ratio, etc.
2. To visualize and compare education data across various countries and regions.
3. To identify trends, patterns, and gaps in global education.
4. To generate meaningful dashboards using Power BI for interactive exploration.
5. To derive actionable insights and suggestions based on the data analysis.
## Tools & Technologies Used
-  Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel / CSV
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Power Query Editor
- My Sql Community server

- Google colab (Python)
## Questions(KPI)
- What is the total number of male vs. female students globally?
- How many students are enrolled in developed vs. developing countries?
- What is the gender distribution among students in developed and developing countries?
- How many students are employed vs. seeking employment, categorized by gender?
- What is the average employment rate by region (e.g., Asia, Europe, Africa)?
- Which region has the highest percentage of employed students?
- How does the employment rate differ between developed and developing regions?
- What is the average salary by country for graduates?

## Conclusion
The global education system demonstrates a strong gender balance, with nearly equal participation
from male and female students. Developed countries show higher student enrollment, employment
rates, and salary outcomes compared to developing regions. Europe leads in employment percentage,
while fields like Engineering and Economics are the most pursued. Top global universities continue to
attract large student populations. However, developing countries face challenges in aligning education
with employment, indicating a need for improved integration and opportunities.
